    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>I like to use this recipe for drop biscuits: <a href="https://bakerbettie.com/5-ingredient-basic-drop-biscuits/"">Biscuits</a></p>
    <p>It's pretty easy! Basically, you need flour, milk, butter, and a few other dry ingredients. Use cold hard butter and shred it with a cheese grater before mixing into the flour. You can drop the biscuit dough straight into the cast iron skillet or cut them up with a circle cookie cutter and place on a baking tray.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>240 grams (~2 cups) all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>14 grams (1 tablespoon) baking powder</li>
        <li>1 3/4 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
        <li>113 grams (1 stick or 1/2 cup) unsalted butter, <em>very cold and cut into small pieces</em></li>
        <li>170-227 grams (3/4 to 1 cup) milk or buttermilk</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 450&degF</li>
        <li>In large bowl, whisk together dry ingredients</li>
        <li>Add chunks of the cold butter into the dry ingredients and use a pastry cutter or fork to combine</li>
        <li>Add milk or buttermilk to mixture and stir until just combined</li>
        <li>Drop large mounds of batter into a buttered cast iron skillet or onto a parchment lined baking sheet</li>
        <li>Bake for 16-20 minutes until golden brown</li>
        <li>Brush with melted butter after biscuits have finished baking</li>
    </ol>

    <p>As a bonus, you can mix in shredded cheddar cheese when mixing the dry ingredients and then brush biscuits with a mixture of melted butter and garlic powder. Will taste just like some Red Lobster biscuits!</p>
