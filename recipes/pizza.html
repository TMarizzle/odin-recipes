    <h2>Pizza Dough</h2>
    <p>Gotta start with some homemade pizza dough. I like to use this recipe from King Arthur baking: <a href="https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/recipes/pick-your-pan-pizza-recipe">Pizza Dough Recipe</a></p>
    <h3>Get to Baking!</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>Gather ingredients</li>
            <li>Combine dry ingredients in large bowl and mix until combined</li>
            <li>Activate yeast (if using active dry yeast) by adding a little bit of sugar to warm water and then adding the yeast to the water</li>
            <li>Let yeast sit for about 5-10 minutes and it should start foaming (if not, your yeast might be dead)</li>
            <li>Once yeast has started foaming, add to dry ingredients along with some olive oil</li>
            <li>Mix all ingredients to form sticky dough ball (add more flour if needed)</li>
            <li>Let dough rise for 15-20 minutes, punch down and let rise again for another 15-20 minutes</li>
            <li>Move dough into oiled baking pan and slowly spread/stretch dough to fill pan</li>
            <li>Let rise for 60-90 minutes</li>
            <li>Add toppings and bake!</li>
        </ul>
