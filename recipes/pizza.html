    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Pizza is a great choice for any meal time. This recipe uses a pan style dough for a thicker crust and the fun part is you can use just about any style of pan for it! Whether you want to use a cast iron skillet or a regular baking pan, this dough will work for you. Feel free to get creative with the toppings too!</p>
    <p>Gotta start with some homemade pizza dough! I like to use this recipe from King Arthur baking: <a href="https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/recipes/pick-your-pan-pizza-recipe">Pizza Dough Recipe</a></p>
    <p>The dough will acquire more flavor if you make it ahead of time and leave in the fridge overnight. The dough still tastes great if you decide to make and bake the same day though! And of course, store bought pizza dough is always a fallback option.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        Dough
        <li>3 Cups (360 grams) flour (bread flour preferred, but can use regular flour as well)</li>
        <li>1 1/2 Teaspoons table salt</li>
        <li>1 Teaspoon instant yeast (or active dry yeast)</li>
        <li>1 Cup plus 3 tablespoons of warm water</li>
        <li>~2 Tablespoons of olive oil</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        Toppings
        <li>1/3 to 1/2 Cup pizza sauce</li>
        <li>6 oz Mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>Pepperoni, sausage, or other meat <em>(I prefer pepperoni!)</em></li>
        <li>Parmesan and fresh herbs to sprinkle on top after baking</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather ingredients</li>
            <li>Combine dry ingredients in large bowl and mix until combined</li>
            <li>Activate yeast (if using active dry yeast) by adding a little bit of sugar to warm water and then adding the yeast to the water</li>
            <li>Let yeast sit for about 5-10 minutes and it should start foaming (if not, your yeast might be dead)</li>
            <li>Once yeast has started foaming, add to dry ingredients along with 1 tablespoon of olive oil</li>
            <li>Mix all ingredients to form sticky dough ball (add more flour if needed)</li>
            <li>Let dough rise for 15-20 minutes, punch down and let rise again for another 15-20 minutes</li>
            <li>Move dough into oiled baking pan and slowly spread/stretch dough to fill pan</li>
            <li>Let rise for 60-90 minutes</li>
            <li>While dough is rising for the final time, preheat oven to 500 <em>(Add a pizza stone in the oven beforehand for bonus points!)</em></li>
            <li>Add pizza sauce, cheese, and any additional toppings to pizza dough <em>(Go easy on the sauce and toppings to not weigh down the dough and make it sink)</em></li>
            <li>Once oven has preheated and you've prepared your toppings, bake the pizza for 15-20 minutes until the cheese is bubbling and the crust has turned golden</li>
            <li>Let the pizza cool for a few minutes and then remove from pan to a cooling rack so the dough doesn't get soggy</li>
            <li>And now the hardest part, you have to wait! Don't cut into the pizza right away, but let it cool down for at least 10 minutes. Giving the pizza time to cool down lets the cheese hold together better so it doesn't all slide off as one molten hot piece to slap your chin for your first bite.</li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    <p>Be sure to add some extra freshly grated parmesan cheese on top and maybe a few hits of crushed red pepper. Enjoy!</p>
