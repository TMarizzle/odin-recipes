    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>You can find the recipe here: <a href="https://www.blondelish.com/recipes/creamy-bacon-and-mushroom-risotto-recipe/">Mushroom Risotto</a></p>
    <p>Risotto is a fantastic meal to learn to cook and can be quite versatile with all the things you can add into it to make it your own. The only downside: it can take quite a long time to cook and you have to stir it consistently. As long as you're prepared for that, let's begin!</p>
    <p>Risotto is a creamy rice dish that uses chicken stock to slowly turn the hard rice soft and warm delight. This recipe will use chopped mushrooms and bacon to add more delicious flavors into the dish.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/4 Cup Arborio rice</li>
        <li>4 Cups of stock</li>
        <li>1/2 Cup white or rose wine</li>
        <li>1/2 Grated Parmesan</li>
        <li>1 Tablespoon of Olive Oil</li>
        <li>1 Onion, finely sliced</li>
        <li>3 Garlic cloves, minced or pressed</li>
        <li>3 1/2 oz smoked bacon, chopped</li>
        <li>10 oz mixed mushrooms, sliced</li>
        <li>Fresh herbs to garnish</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil in a large frying pan or dutch oven and cook onion for 4-5 minutes to soften</li>
        <li>Stir in bacon and cook for 3 minutes</li>
        <li>Add garlic and mushrooms, cook for 5 more minutes</li>
        <li>Stir in rice adn cook until juices are absorbed</li>
        <li>Add wine and let it reduce for 2-3 minutes</li>
        <li>Add stock one ladelful at a time, stirring well</li>
        <li>Let the rice absorb most of the stock before adding more - it will take about 15-20 minutes to add all the stock</li>
        <li>After all the stock has been added and absorbed, add in grated parmesan</li>
        <li>Garnish with fresh herbs and serve while hot</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Be sure to stir consistently, but not constantly. You don't have to stir it nonstop, but you do need to stir it often to make sure the rice doesn't stick to the bottom of the pan. You can also save some of the bacon or make extra to use as an extra garnish on top (or just to have more bacon!).</p>
    <p>The parmesan in your plastic parmesan cheese shaker can work in a pinch, but freshly grated is preferred.</p>
